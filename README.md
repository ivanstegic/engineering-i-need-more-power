# Engineering! I need more power!

A Reveal.js presentation on Kubernetes Operators with a Final Frontier theme.

## Summary

We know how it is, you're just chilling in Main Engineering, when the captain demands more power! Your Kubernetes application relies on k8s definitions, internal applications, and external APIs. Scaling up to handle more capacity requires manual processes. But what if we could encode all that knowledge into a resident, privileged on-cluster application?

In this talk, we'll introduce Operators as a development pattern, and the Operator SDK as a means to make an Operator based on Ansible code.
